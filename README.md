Hi! This repository contains the code and presentation materials from my talk at the Golang-Syd meetup on the 30th of November 2023. The `presentation` directory contains my speaker notes and slides. The rest of the directory contains the code used in my talk. If you look at the commit history, you can see a commit for each checkpoint (used in the talk) to make it easier to follow along.
